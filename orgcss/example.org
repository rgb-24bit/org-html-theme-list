* Introduction

  This Tutorial describes one of many ways to publishing Org-mode files to
  XHTML. We use the publishing mechanism to keep the =*.html= files separated
  from our =*.org= files and to access them via web browser. Simply exporting the
  Org-mode files to HTML would leave them in =~/org/=.

  The XHTML files we create will work every where, on any host, with or without
  network access, and even when accessed through the =file:///= protocol. To
  achieve this goal, we use

  - no absolute paths in HTML,
  - no server side scripting to navigate our output directories,
  - no =base= element (which is optional as of XHTML 1.0 strict) and
  - no software, but emacs, Org-mode and a web browser.

  All this means, we are able to check and use the result of work immediately,
  everywhere.

* Basics

  Throughout this tutorial, let's assume that all our Org-mode files live beneath
  =~/org/= and we publish them to =~/public_html/=.

  Let's further assume you're already familiar with the note taking basics in
  org and able to add a little content to the Org-mode files we add to our project
  during this tutorial. Please add at least one headline to each of the files.

  The first thing to do is to create the folder =~/org=. This is where our notes
  files live. Inside =~/org/= we have a folder =css/= for stylesheets and
  scripts, and a folder called =img/= (guess what's in there).

  The first file we add to that folder (and to subdirectories later on) is called
  =index.org=. This name was choosen, since Org will publish the files to those
  with the basename of the source file plus the extension =.html= [fn:1]. Thus
  =~/org/index.org= will once be =~/public_html/index.html= -- the startpage.

  Let's add another file and call it =~/org/remember.org=. After adding a
  stylesheet, =~/org/= looks like this:

  : ~/org/
  :    |- css/
  :    |  `- stylesheet.css
  :    |- img/
  :    |- index.org
  :    `- remember.org

  When ever you want to add link to a file, do it the usual way. To link from
  =index.org= to =remember.org=, just write
  : [[file:remember.org][remember]]
  Org will convert those links to HTML links for you on export:
  : <a href="./remember.html">remember</a>

  Same is true for images. To add an image, put it in =~/org/img/test.jpg= and
  refer to it by
  : [[file:img/test.jpg]]

  You may test your links by clicking on them. To test image links you may also
  try to turn on =iimage-mode= [fn:2] which works without problems here.

  Optionally, set up the stylesheet as shown in section Special comment
  section. The recommended way is to use a real stylesheet though.

* Publishing the /org/ project

  To publish the =~/org/= project to HTML, we'll have to setup the variable
  =org-publish-project-alist= [fn:3].  I tend to split each project in three basic
  /components/ as described in the manual. We need these different components,
  since we want org to use two different functions to publish dynamic content
  (org => html) and static content like scripts, images, stylesheets or even
  .htaccess files (org => copy). The third component is just for convenience and
  tells org to execute the former ones.

  =org-publish-project-alist= may be adjusted using customize (=M-x
  customize-variable RET org-publish-project-alist RET=), but I prefere to
  use an extra file to setup my projects, since there are quite a few. To follow
  this tutorial use the =*scratch*= buffer and put all the Lisp in this section
  in there.

  First of all, enter this into the =*scratch*= buffer:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(

       ;; ... add all the components here (see below)...

      ))
#+end_src

  Be sure to put all the /components/ below right there where the comment line
  is now.

** The /notes/ component

   The /notes/ component publishes all the Org-mode files to HTML. Hence the
   =publishing-function= is set to =org-publish-org-to-html=. Here is an example
   of the notes component:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
("org-notes"
 :base-directory "~/org/"
 :base-extension "org"
 :publishing-directory "~/public_html/"
 :recursive t
 :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
 :headline-levels 4             ; Just the default for this project.
 :auto-preamble t
 )
#+end_src

   Note, that =headline-levels= may be adjusted on a per file basis to overwrite
   the default.

   The most important settings here are:

   | =base-directory=       | The components root directory.                                                                                            |
   | =base-extension=       | Filename suffix without the dot.                                                                                          |
   | =publishing-directory= | The base directory where all our files will be published.                                                                 |
   | =recursive=            | If =t=, include subdirectories - we want that. Subdirectories in =:publishing-directory= are created if they don't yet exist. |
   | =publishing-function=  | If and how org should process the files in this component. In this case: convert the Org-mode files to HTML.              |

** The /static/ component

   The /static/ component just copies files (and their folders) from
   =:base-directory= to =:publishing-directory= without changing them. Thus
   let's tell Org-mode to use the function =org-publish-attachment=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
("org-static"
 :base-directory "~/org/"
 :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf"
 :publishing-directory "~/public_html/"
 :recursive t
 :publishing-function org-publish-attachment
 )
#+end_src

   *Note* that =:publishing-function= is set to =org-publish-attachment=.

** The /publish/ component

   To publish all with one command, we add the /publish/ component. For this
   component I usually drop the suffix and just use the basename of the
   project.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ("org" :components ("org-notes" "org-static"))
#+end_src

   Now =M-x org-publish-project RET org RET= publishes everything
   recursively to =~/public_html/=. Target directories are created, if they
   don't yet exist.

** Pooh - can we publish now?

   The good message is *yes, we can*. Just one little hump. Since we've put the
   definition for our publishing components in the =*scratch*= buffer, again,
   make sure all the /components/ are enclosed by the lines

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(

       ;; ... all the components ...

      ))
#+end_src

   Move to the end of the first line and press =C-x C-e= to load
   =org-publish=. Now go to the end of the last line and press =C-x C-e=
   again. Repeat the last step after every change to your
   =org-publish-project-alist=.

   To publish your Org-mode files just type
   =M-x org-publish-project RET org RET= or use one of the shortcuts listed in
   the manual. If nothing went wrong, you should now be able to point your
   browser to http://localhost/~user/, if =mod_userdir= is set up. If
   not, simply navigate to file:///home/user/public_html (you might use
   /file -> open/ from the file menu of your browser.

* Adding directories

  As we add more and more files to =~/org/=, we will soon end up with filenames
  like '=networking-ssh-sshd-config.org=' or longer. What we need is a
  directory structure:

  : ~/org/
  :   |- css/
  :   |  `- stylesheet.css
  :   |- Emacs
  :   |  |- index.org
  :   |  |- gnus.org
  :   |  |- org.org
  :   |  `- snippets.org
  :   |- img/
  :   |- index.org
  :   `- remember.org

  If we hadn't added
  :      :recursive t
  in the /notes/ and /static/ components already, we would have to do it now at
  the latest to export the subdirectories too.

* Overwrite the defaults

  The defaults set by =org-publish-project-alist= may be overwritten. You might
  want to justify the export properties for single files. Be it the level of
  headlines, include extry scripts or different stylesheets. Org offers ways to adjust
  the settings for a single file.

** The export options template

   The first choice is the /export options template/ on top of the file. When in
   an Org-mode file, you may insert basic information using =C-c C-e #=
   (=org-export-dispatch=) plus "template".  You will be prompted for a template
   choice.  "default" will provide a template for common options, and "html"
   will provide a template for HTML-specific options.

   WARNING: Do *not* copy lines from the sample output below into your
   files. The template might change from release to release. Instead,
   insert a template as above and delete any entries that are not
   applicable.

   The default option inserts the following lines:
   
   : #+TITLE: filename with the extension omitted
   : #+DATE: <2013-06-04 Tue>
   : #+AUTHOR: Your name
   : #+EMAIL: Your email address
   : #+OPTIONS: ':t *:t -:t ::t <:t H:3 \n:nil ^:t arch:headline author:t c:nil
   : #+OPTIONS: creator:comment d:(not LOGBOOK) date:t e:t email:nil f:t inline:t
   : #+OPTIONS: num:t p:nil pri:nil stat:t tags:t tasks:t tex:t timestamp:t toc:t
   : #+OPTIONS: todo:t |:t
   : #+CREATOR: Emacs 24.3.50.3 (Org mode 8.0.3)
   : #+DESCRIPTION:
   : #+EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport
   : #+KEYWORDS:
   : #+LANGUAGE: en
   : #+SELECT_TAGS: export

   and the html option will add the following:

   : #+OPTIONS: html-postamble:auto html-preamble:t tex:t
   : #+CREATOR: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> 24.3.50.3 (<a href="https://orgmode.org">Org</a> mode 8.0.3)
   : #+HTML_CONTAINER: div
   : #+HTML_DOCTYPE: xhtml-strict
   : #+HTML_HEAD:
   : #+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA:
   : #+HTML_HTML5_FANCY:
   : #+HTML_INCLUDE_SCRIPTS:
   : #+HTML_INCLUDE_STYLE:
   : #+HTML_LINK_HOME:
   : #+HTML_LINK_UP:
   : #+HTML_MATHJAX:
   : #+INFOJS_OPT:

   All we have to do now is to alter the options to match our needs. All the
   options are listed in the wonderful Org-mode manual. Note though, that these
   options are only parsed on startup (i.e., when you first open the file). To
   explicitly apply your new options move on any of those lines and press =C-c=
   twice.

** <<<Special comment section>>>

   Also, CSS style variables may be using a special section may be
   #insert/appended to Org-mode files:

   : * COMMENT html style specifications
   :
   : # Local Variables:
   : # org-export-html-style: "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/stylesheet.css\" />"
   : # End:

   =css/stylesheet.css= suits the needs for a file in the root folder. Use \\
   =../css/stylesheet.css= in a subfolder (first level), \\
   =../../css/stylesheet.css= for a file in a sub-sub-folder.

* Tired of export templates?

 If you're like me, you will soon get tired of adding the same export options
 template to numerous files and adjust the title and paths in it. Luckily,
 Org-mode supports laziness and offers an additional way to set up files. All
 we need is a directory (e.g. =~/.emacs.d/org-templates/=) and create the
 following files there:

 + =level-0.org= \\
   This file contains all export options lines. The special comment section
   will not work for files in subdirectories. Hence we always use the export
   options line
   :#+STYLE: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" />
   ...suitable for each file in the projects root folder
   (=~/org/= or =~/B/= in the examples). Just drop the =#+TITLE= since this
   will be different for every file and automatically set on export (based on
   the filename if omitted).
 + =level-1.org= \\
   This file contains all export options lines for the stylesheet suitable for
   each file in a subfolder of the projects root folder (e.g. =~/org/emacs/=
   or =~/org/networking/=). Just drop the =#+TITLE= again. The options line
   for the stylesheet looks like this:
   :#+STYLE: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../stylesheet.css" />

 + Add more files for more levels.

 Now remove the special comment section from the end of your Org-mode files in
 the project folders and change the export options template to

 : #+SETUPFILE: ~/.emacs.d/org-templates/level-N.org
 : #+TITLE: My Title

 Replace =N= with distance to the root folder (=0=, =1= etc.) of your project
 and press =C-c= twice while still on this line to apply the
 changes. Subsequent lines still overwrite the settings for just this one file.


** More level files

  Also, these /level-N/ files give us the chance to easily switch between different
  export setups. As an example, we could have a separate stylesheet and
  =org-info.js= setup for presentations, and put the appropriate options in a
  file named =level-0-slides.org=:

  : #+INFOJS_OPT: path:org-info.js
  : #+INFOJS_OPT: toc:nil view:slide
  : #+STYLE: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="slides.css" />

  Now it's as simple as typing '/-slides/' to change the appearance of any file
  in our project.

* More Projects

   As we get used to note taking in org, we might add an =org= directory to most
   of our projects. All those projects are published as well. Project '=~/B/='
   is published to '=~/public_html/B/=', '=~/C/=' is published to
   '=~/public_html/C/=', and so on. This leads to the problem of common
   stylesheets and current JavaScripts --- and to a new /component/.

** The /inherit/ component

   Once we get tired of copying the static files from one project to another, the
   following configuration does the trick for us. We simply add the /inherit/
   component, that imports all the static files from our =~/org/= directory [fn:4].
   From now on, it will be sufficient to edit stylesheets and scripts just
   there.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ("B-inherit"
  :base-directory "~/org/"
  :recursive t
  :base-extension "css\\|js"
  :publishing-directory "~/public_html/B/"
  :publishing-function org-publish-attachment
 )

 ("B-org"
 :base-directory "~/B/"
 :auto-index t
 :index-filename "sitemap.org"
 :index-title "Sitemap"
 :recursive t
 :base-extension "org"
 :publishing-directory "~/public_html/B/"
 :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
 :headline-levels 3
 :auto-preamble t
 )
 ("B-static"
  :base-directory "~/B/"
  :recursive t
  :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf"
  :publishing-directory "~/public_html/B/"
  :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

 ("B" :components ("B-inherit" "B-notes" "B-static"))
#+end_src

   *Note*, that the inheritance trick works for non org directories. You might
   want to keep all your stylesheets and scripts in a single place, or even add
   more /inheritance/ to your projects, to import sources from upstream.

   *Note* also, that =B-inherit= exports directly to the web. If you want to track
   the changes to =~org/*.css= directly in =~/B=, you must ensure, that =B-inherit= is
   the first component in =B= since the components in =B= are executed in
   the sequence listed: first get the new stylesheet into =B=, then execute
   =B-static=.

*** One more Example

    As I use org-info.js and track Worg git, I use "=inherit-org-info-js=" in all
    my =org= projects:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ("inherit-org-info-js"
  :base-directory "~/develop/org/Worg/code/org-info-js/"
  :recursive t
  :base-extension "js"
  :publishing-directory "~/org/"
  :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

 ;; ... all the rest ... ;;

 ("B" :components ("inherit-org-info-js" "B-inherit" "B-notes" "B-static"))
 ("C" :components ("inherit-org-info-js" "C-inherit" "C-notes" "C-static"))
 ("D" :components ("inherit-org-info-js" "D-inherit" "D-notes" "D-static"))
 ("E" :components ("inherit-org-info-js" "E-inherit" "E-notes" "E-static"))
#+end_src

    ...means, =B= =C= =D= and =E= use my local stylesheets and always the latest
    version of =org-info.js=.

* Overview

  Once there are lots of files and subdirectories, we're in the need of ways to
  easily navigate our notes in a browser. What we need now, is an index, an
  overview of all our note files.

** The sitemap

   Org-modes great publishing also generates a recursive sitemap. Its name 
   defaults to =sitemap.org=, which get's in our way, since we have a real 
   startpage as =sitemap.html= [fn:5]. Fortunately there is a configuration 
   option to change the name of the generated sitemap. To generate the sitemap,
   add these lines to the /notes/ component:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 :auto-sitemap t                ; Generate sitemap.org automagically...
 :sitemap-filename "sitemap.org"  ; ... call it sitemap.org (it's the default)...
 :sitemap-title "Sitemap"         ; ... with title 'Sitemap'.
#+end_src

   The sitemap will reflect the tree structure of the project. To access the
   sitemap easily, we could do two things:

   1. Setup the '/UP/' link of the Startpage to link to =sitemap.html= (see next
      section),
   2. use the '=#+INCLUDE: sitemap.org=' directive. Most of my Org-mode files
      contain a chapter called "/Links/" at the end of the file, which contains
      a subsection /Sitemap/ that in turn just consists of that
      diretive. For the =index.org= files in the root directory, I include the
      sitemap as the first section.

   You can also change the position of folders with =:sitemap-sort-folders=,
   this can be set to =last= or =first= (default), to display folders last or 
   first.

** org-info.js

   Another way to get additional links to navigate the structure is
   org-info.js. Let's set it up like this (either in every file, or in
   =org-level-N.org=, where =N > 0=):

   : #+LINK_UP: index.html

   This makes the little /UP/ link ('=h=') point to the =index.html= in the
   current directory.

   The =index.org= in the root of the project has the /index file/ as section 2
   (which I may reach pressing '=n=' then), and the same option set like this:

   : #+LINK_UP: sitemap.html

   For an =index.org= in a subdirectory:

   : #+LINK_UP: ../index.html

   The =LINK_HOME= always points to the same file:

   : #+LINK_HOME: http://localhost/~user/index.html

   Please consider replacing the last one with a relative path (which will be
   different for every level of subdirectories).

   No matter where we are, we may always press =H n= and we face the sitemap.
   No matter where we are, we may always press =h= to move up the tree.

* Special symbols

  This is a list of LaTeX symbols understood by Org-mode. You may use most of
  those LaTeX symbols to get the desired results (shown in the first column)
  when exporting to HTML. Note though, that not all symbols are translated to
  HTML. They are listed anyway, since they may be used for LaTeX export
  nonetheless. Some characters in the first column are invisible (spaces). To
  see them, mark the part of the table using the mouse.

  You may produce special HTML characters for verbatim =#+BEGIN\_HTML= sections
  using http://www-atm.physics.ox.ac.uk/user/iwi/charmap.html (download link on
  the bottom of that page).

* Further reading

   For more information you might want to read the great Org-mode manual. One of
   the nicest mailing lists on this planet, BTW, is emacs-orgmode (archive)
   where you might as well find answers to your questions.


   Have fun!




* Footnotes

[fn:1]  You may customize the file suffix for exported files like this:
 =M-x customize RET org-export-html-extension=.

[fn:2]  ...by typing =M-x iimage-mode RET=. iimage-mode even shows *.svg images, if
 =librsvg= was present on compile time. FIXME: is this true for emacs22 ?

[fn:3]  All components of =org-publish-projects-alist= are documented in the Org Mode
    Manual.

[fn:4]  Files may be copied from arbitrary src directories to any target directory
 desired.

[fn:5]  This is primarily because of the behaviour of servers. When we navigate
 to https://orgmode.org/worg/ we will face the =index.html= if present.
